### 4. Resolve decision-needed findings

If `decision_needed` findings exist, present each one with its detail and the options available. The user must decide — the correct fix is ambiguous without their input. Walk through each finding (or batch related ones) and get the user's call. Once resolved, each becomes a `patch`, `defer`, or is dismissed.

If the user chooses to defer, ask: Quick one-line reason for deferring this item? (helps future reviews): — then append that reason to both the story file bullet and the `{deferred_work_file}` entry.

**HALT** — I am waiting for your numbered choice. Reply with only the number. Do not proceed until you select an option.

### 5. Handle `patch` findings

If `patch` findings exist (including any resolved from step 4), HALT. Ask the user:

If `{spec_file}` is set, present all three options:

> **How would you like to handle the `<P>` `patch` findings?**
> 1. **Apply every patch** — fix all of them now, no per-finding confirmation. Defer and decision-needed items are not touched.
> 2. **Leave as action items** — they are already in the story file
> 3. **Walk through each patch** — show details for each before deciding

If `{spec_file}` is **not** set, present only options 1 and 2 (omit "Leave as action items" — findings were not written to a file):

> **How would you like to handle the `<P>` `patch` findings?**
> 1. **Apply every patch** — fix all of them now, no per-finding confirmation. Defer and decision-needed items are not touched.
> 2. **Walk through each patch** — show details for each before deciding

**HALT** — I am waiting for your numbered choice. Reply with only the number. Do not proceed until you select an option.

- **Apply every patch**: Apply every patch finding without per-finding confirmation. Do not modify defer or decision-needed items. After all patches are applied, present a summary of changes made. If `{spec_file}` is set, check off the patch items in the story file (leave defer items as-is).
- **Leave as action items** (only when `{spec_file}` is set): Done — findings are already written to the story.
- **Walk through each patch**: Present each finding with full detail, diff context, and suggested fix. After walkthrough, re-offer the applicable options above.

  **HALT** — I am waiting for your numbered choice. Do not proceed until you select an option.

**✅ Code review actions complete**

- Decision-needed resolved: <D>
- Patches handled: <P>
- Deferred: <W>
- Dismissed: <R>

### 6. Update story status and sync sprint tracking

Skip this section if `{spec_file}` is not set.

#### Determine new status based on review outcome

- If all `decision-needed` and `patch` findings were resolved (fixed or dismissed) AND no unresolved `high`/`medium` findings remain: set `{new_status}` = `done`. Update the story file Status section to `done`.
- If `patch` findings were left as action items, or unresolved issues remain: set `{new_status}` = `in-progress`. Update the story file Status section to `in-progress`.

Save the story file.

#### Sync sprint-status.yaml

If `{story_key}` is not set, skip this subsection and note that sprint status was not synced because no story key was available.

If `{sprint_status}` file exists:

1. Load the FULL `{sprint_status}` file.
2. Find the `development_status` entry matching `{story_key}`.
3. If found: update `development_status[{story_key}]` to `{new_status}`. Update `last_updated` to current date. Save the file, preserving ALL comments and structure including STATUS DEFINITIONS.
4. If `{story_key}` not found in sprint status: warn the user that the story file was updated but sprint-status sync failed.

If `{sprint_status}` file does not exist, note that story status was updated in the story file only.

#### Completion summary

> **Review Complete!**
>
> **Story Status:** `{new_status}`
> **Issues Fixed:** <fixed_count>
> **Action Items Created:** <action_count>
> **Deferred:** <W>
> **Dismissed:** <R>

### 7. Next steps

Present the user with follow-up options:

> **What would you like to do next?**
> 1. **Start the next story** — run `dev-story` to pick up the next `ready-for-dev` story
> 2. **Re-run code review** — address findings and review again
> 3. **Done** — end the workflow

**HALT** — I am waiting for your choice. Do not proceed until the user selects an option.

## On Complete

Run: `python3 {project-root}/_bmad/scripts/resolve_customization.py --skill {skill-root} --key workflow.on_complete`

If the resolved `workflow.on_complete` is non-empty, follow it as the final terminal instruction before exiting.
